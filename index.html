            <p>Girl Reporter, in an attempt to expose the underground abortion ring in Chicago, sneaks “around like a snake trying to make a reputation” and seduces doctors with “many a pearly tear trembling on her pretty eyelids,” (Page, 32-33). </p>
            <p>The unnamed female reporter was accompanied by a male reporter when she posed as a desperate, pregnant woman to uncover the abortionist ring (Page 32). The stories made the front page everyday for nearly a month (Page, 32-33). Following the story, the city editor of the Chicago Times quit “in disgust,” letters of both disgust and praise flooded in, and readers found it both repulsive and irresistible (Todd, 3). </p>
            <p>Girl Reporter, even while remaining completely anonymous, had a wide reach because she dared talk about women and sex publicly (Todd, 4). </p>
        
    <h3>Women in Journalism in 1880</h3>
    <p>Gender discrimination during the 1880s was institutionalized and rarely questioned (Todd, 40). Women aspiring to work as journalists had limited options. The women’s pages were sections in newspapers dedicated to fashion, cooking, gardening, and anything else that appeared to be inherently feminine. These sources were considered “fluff” and “irrelevant”. Journalism that covered politics and crime was only appropriate for men to report on, making it nearly impossible for women to leave their designated spaces.
    </p>
    <p>Society was conditioned to believe that men and women existed in two separate spheres. Even when female journalists showed interest and skill in reporting on other types of stories, they were shoved back to the women’s pages (Kroeger, 48). Female journalists, it seemed, could not escape the pre-existing binaries. Worse, though, was that men rarely tolerated the women’s pages (Whitt, 40). Both editors and male journalists “denigrated” these spaces they’d created to confine women (Whitt, 40).  </p>
    <p>This discrimination exemplifies the startling and sudden shift that stunt girls brought to the journalism field. </p>

    <h3>Stunt Journalism</h3>
    
    <p>Predating the muckrakers, stunt journalism was a brief and unique style of investigative journalism that emerged in 1887. Pioneered by Nellie Bly, female journalists, publishing under pseudonyms, went undercover to investigate social issues that specifically impacted women. Copying Bly’s style, these stories were longform narratives that ensnared readers’ attention while allowing journalists to depict themselves as brave heroines. They did this all while celebrating their femininity in a public manner that hadn’t been seen before. This style was so enthralling that large newspapers across the country were hiring their own stunt girls, hoping to mimic Bly’s work and profit off of the craze while it lasted.</p>
    <p>Stunt journalism emerged with Nellie Bly, who’s real name is Elizabeth Jane Cochran, and the New York World in 1887 after Bly had herself committed to the infamous Blackwell Island Asylum to document the deplorable conditions women were subjected to (Bly, 17). Her story exposed mental and physical abuse, patients being forced to eat spoiled food, wrongfully institutionalized women, and alleged deaths because of the poor treatment (Bly). Readers were fascinated with her exposé and the public was shocked that a woman was able to trick police, a judge, and multiple doctors into believing she’s actually insane.</p>
    <p>Bly’s debut with the World created the first overlap of two independent worlds: women and journalism. Stung girls were the first group of women to make a collective shift from the women’s pages to the front pages of newspapers. These women tore their way to those front pages, captured the country’s undivided attention, and still wrote about their unique experiences as women. They “offered a vision of womanhood that hadn’t appeared in newspapers before–brave and charming, fiercely independent, professional and ambitious, yet unabashedly female” (Todd).

        <blockquote class="quote">
          Journalists like Bly, Eva Gay, Girl Reporter, and countless other women “adopted roles forbidden to them” and “told the truth experienced by their bodies. They wrote about crushes and concerns about their hair. These reporters were deemed silly, sentimental, or sensational–all criticisms of ‘feminine’ writing,” and yet, “they changed the journalistic landscape,” - Kim Todd, "Sensational".
