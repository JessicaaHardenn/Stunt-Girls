    <p>Stunt journalism was the first overlap of two independent worlds: “women’s reporting” and journalism. For the first time, women were reporting on serious issues, like politics, mental health, working conditions, etc. while also unabashedly embracing their femininity. Previously, women wrote about gardening and fashion, or they hid the impact of their gender so they could be taken seriously. Instead, stunt girls tore their way to the front pages of newspapers, captured the country’s undivided attention, and still wrote about their unique experiences as women. Stunt journalism “offered a vision of womanhood that hadn’t appeared in newspapers before–brave and charming, fiercely independent, professional and ambitious, yet unabashedly female” (Smithsonian).
