    <p>During the 1880s, women aspiring to work as journalists had limited options. The “women’s pages” were sections in newspapers dedicated to fashion, cooking, gardening, and anything else that appeared to be inherently feminine (source). These stories were considered just “fluff” and “irrelevant” (women in the media). Journalism that covered politics and crime was only appropriate for men to report on, making it nearly impossible for women to leave their designated spaces.
    </p>
    <p>This form of discrimination was so institutionalized that it wasn’t questioned (women in American journalism). Society was conditioned that men and women existed in two separate spheres (women in American journalism). Some women, like Nellie Bly, showed both interest and skill in reporting on other types of stories. During Bly’s time with the Pittsburgh Dispatch, she wrote stories about divorce reform and the lives of working women (pg 42-42 Bly). Even though the stories attracted wide attention, her editor shoved her back to the women’s pages afterwards (48). Women, it seemed, could not escape the pre-existing binaries that existed in journalism. Worse, though, was that men rarely tolerated the women’s pages (women in the media). Both editors and male journalists “denigrated” these spaces they’d created to confine women (women in the media).
    </p>
    <p>This exemplifies the startling and sudden shift that stunt girls brought to the journalism field. Stunt girls were the first group of women to make a collective shift from the women’s pages to the front page of newspapers. This was the first time women were regularly reporting on issues that were only appropriate for men. Stunt journalism created the first overlap of two independent worlds: women and journalism. Pioneered by Nellie Bly, women were reporting on serious issues that mattered to the general public, including men, while also shamelessly embracing their femininity. Stunt girls tore their way to the front pages of newspapers, captured the country’s undivided attention, and still wrote about their unique experiences as women.

        <p>Stunt journalism "offered a vision of womanhood that hadn't appeared in newspapers before--brave and charming, fiercely independent, professional and ambitious, yet unabashadly female."</p>

    <p>Predating the muckrakers, stunt journalism was a brief and unique style of investigative journalism that emerged in the late 1880s. Female journalists, publishing under pseudonyms, went undercover to investigate social issues that were specifically important to women. Copying Bly’s style, these stories were longform narratives that ensnared readers’ attention while allowing the journalists to depict themselves as brave heroines (SOURCE). They did this all while celebrating their femininity in a public manner that hadn’t been seen before. This style was so enthralling that large newspapers across the country were hiring their own stunt girls, hoping to mimic Bly’s work and profit off of the craze while it lasted (SOURCE).

        <p>Journalists like Bly, Nell Nelson, Eva Gay, Girl Reporter, and countless other women “adopted roles forbidden to them” and “told the truth experienced by their bodies. They wrote about crushes and concerns about their hair. These reporters were deemed silly, sentimental, or sensational–all criticisms of ‘feminine’ writing,” and yet, “they changed the journalistic landscape,” (Sensational).</p>
