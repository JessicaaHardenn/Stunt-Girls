    <h1>Female Camaraderie</h1>
    <h2>Nellie Bly</h2>

    <img src="../style/images/Bly-stand.jpg" class="img-jour">
    <p>Stunt journalism emerged with Nellie Bly, who’s real name is Elizabeth Jane Cochran, and the New York World in 1887 after Bly had herself committed to the infamous Blackwell Island Asylum to document the deplorable conditions women were subjected to (Bly collection). Her story exposed mental and physical abuse, patients being forced to eat spoiled food, wrongfully institutionalized women, and alleged deaths because of the poor treatment (Bly collection). Readers were fascinated with her exposé for multiple reasons. Some were shocked that a woman was able to trick police, a judge, and multiple doctors into believing she’s actually insane (front page?).</p>

    

    <p>One important aspect of Bly’s stories, and other stories by stunt girls, is that men couldn’t have written those stories. The topics revolved around women’s issues such as abortion, women’s working conditions, and women’s mental health. Men couldn’t go undercover at women’s factories and mental asylums. A male reporter would need someone to go with him if he wanted to investigate underground abortion rings, and even then, his experience isn’t important because he’s not the center of the story. </p>

    <p>Even if the gender of the subjects was redacted, it is impossible to remove the reporter’s gender from the story. Not only were men unable to report on these stories properly, stunt girls weaved their experiences as women into the smallest details. In “10 Days in a Madhouse,” Bly talks about her sweat “taking the curl out of [her] bangs,” a “bad-looking shawl” she’s forced to wear, the judge referring to her as “someone’s sweetheart”, and Bly joking about the “uneven” length of her skirt (Madhouse). These are concerns, comments, and experiences that men wouldn’t have faced or received. Without these seemingly insignificant descriptions, Bly’s story likely would have been one dimensional. It would be impossible for her to fully depict her experiences at the Blackwell Island Asylum, and fully engage readers, without giving such a detailed narration. Her narration as a woman, specifically, is why thousands of people were so fascinated by her story. </p>

    <p>Further, the poor conditions at the Blackwell Island Asylum were mostly common knowledge (source). Bly’s exposé wasn’t necessarily a groundbreaking investigation. Her series garnered so much attention and landed on the frontpage of the New York World because she wasn’t just a reporter who went undercover, she was a female reporter who went undercover.</p>

    <h2>Girl Reporter</h2>

    <img src="../style/images/infanticide.jpg" class="img-journ">

    <p>Girl Reporter, an unidentified journalist for the Chicago Times, went undercover to investigate illegal abortions in Chicago.  She visited over 200 physicians with a coworker, and wrote an exposé naming the doctors and midwives partaking in this practice, condemning them for infanticide. Her investigation is also the earliest known in-depth study of illegal abortion (smithsonian). </p>

    

    <p>Because abortion was illegal and an incredibly controversial procedure, this story was important to the masses. Most importantly, though, only a woman could thoroughly investigate it, and Girl Reporter reveled in that (sensational). A man couldn’t depict the shame and ridicule unmarried pregnant women faced (sensational). And even with Girl Reporter’s avid disagreement with the procedure, she tried to understand the difficulty women in this predicament face, and inturn found the investigation “tiring” (sensational). It is a universally feminine experience to be humiliated and chastised while male counterparts, like the journalist who was accompanying Girl Reporter, are not reprimanded in the slightest. The biggest impact of Girl Reporter’s series, though, was that she forced readers to understand that women felt “embarrassed, threatened, [and] angry” when talking about sex (sensational). To the dismay of many readers, tons of whom wrote angry letters to the editors, Chicago residents weren’t allowed to ignore women’s experiences.
    </p>

    <h2>Eva Gay</h2>
    <img src="../style/images/eva.jpg" class="img-jour-small">

    <p>Stunt journalists, like Eva Gay, managed to do the same thing in other parts of the country. Gay, who’s real name was Eva McDonald Valesh, was a labor activist in Minnesota who went on to pioneer the labor reform journalism field (writing). The editor of the St. Paul Globe sought her out and asked her to go undercover at various factories to report on women’s working conditions. Again, during this time gender discrimination was institutionalized, so it was normal for employers to subject women to unsafe conditions while paying them an unlivable wage. This series, though, was an attempt to force women to realize their own plight, stressing that the issues she covered were fixable (writing).</p>

    <p>Again, a male reporter wouldn’t have been able to write Gay’s series. Even if he was able to go undercover as a foreman in these factories, the articles would be unsuccessful without a woman’s analysis. Sexism was ingrained in society during this time that a man would likely agree with the foreman that women shouldn’t be allowed to talk and sing during work because it affects productivity (eva’s article). A male journalist might also not take issue with the factories painting windows because “women ought to be kept where men couldn’t see them” (eva’s article).</p>

    

    <p>Similar to Bly, as Gay describes the threats of violence and sexual harassment working women face, her femininity is also woven through the story. She isn’t entirely focused on the sexual harassment, threats of violence, and social discrimination working women face (gay’s writings). Gay also follows these women to their group homes and writes about “Sundays out” and laughter that bubbled to the surface during work (writing). Her articles are a beautifully crafted call to action and celebration of working women in a time period that was not welcoming to them.</p>
