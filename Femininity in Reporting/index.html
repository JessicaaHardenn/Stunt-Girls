    <h1>Femininity in Reporting</h1>
    <h2>Girl Reporter</h2>

    <p>An underacknowledged factor of stunt journalism, though, was the sense of community these reporters created. There’s an inherent loyalty and camaraderie women have with each other that is exemplified in this style of reporting. The strongest example being Girl Reporter. She vehemently condemned abortion, starting her series with accusations about the lack of virtue Parisians possess because of how common abortions are in Paris (infanticide). Still, she described a “righteous anger” when the doctors condescend her, assuming she’s an “adventuress,” which shouldn’t affect her because she obviously agrees that women shouldn’t seek abortions (sensational). More importantly, though, she still provides detailed instructions on how to get an abortion, including the exact medications and dosages needed for one (sensational). </p>

    <p>While her identity was never revealed and no one was able to ask why she did so, it is easy to speculate that she provided these details because of the loyalty women have to each other. A large part of “womanhood” is this innate desire to protect and help other women, even complete strangers. There’s a sense of community that exists amongst each other. And after temporarily experiencing the dread and shame of women who wanted an abortion, this reporter decided to help those women, even though she condemned the procedure they were seeking. </p>

    <h2>Eva Gay</h2>

    <p>We also see this community in the entirety of Eva Gay’s working women series. Unlike other stunt girls, her articles were targeting women, hoping to inspire them (writing). She was a “witness, organizer,” and reporter for the labor strikes she inspired (writing). Further, even in her individual articles, we see the camaraderie working women have amongst each other. They warn her about the harsh realities of the jobs, offering advice on how to stay safe at work, make light of the discrimination they face, and even invite her home with them after work (writing). There’s no competition between each other, just an urge to help and protect each other.</p>

    <h2>Nellie Bly</h2>

    <p>That urge is exemplified in Bly’s “10 Days in a Madhouse” in multiple forms. First, as part of Bly’s plan to have herself institutionalized, she stayed at a temporary home for women in order to publicly act “insane” (Bly). During her antics, some of the women were so scared that most of them refused to sleep near Bly and one even had nightmares about her (Bly). The women who weren’t scared of Bly, though, teased and tormented her with questions that would’ve been “cruel” if she hadn’t been acting. While this seems to disprove the argument that women protect and care for each other, one woman, Mrs. Caine, “displayed true womanly feeling” and came to Bly’s aid. </p>

    <p>With the rest of the house split between locking Bly up out of fear and the other half content to harass her, it would have been easier for Mrs. Caine to, at the very least, ignore Bly’s existence. While we don’t know if the woman was frightened, Bly does describe Caine coming to her aid and defending her against everyone else. Caine took the bed closest to Bly, took care of her, and spoke to Bly “as a mother would do to an ailing child” (Bly). This compassion and potentially bravery for a seemingly insane and possibly dangerous stranger is, again, womanhood. </p>

    <p>The innate desire to build a community with each other continues while Bly is at the asylum. Her first day at the asylum, a nurse warns Bly that she shouldn’t expect any kindness there because she won’t receive it (51). Between the cruel nurses and the patients stuck in what Bly describes as a “human rat trap” who are just focused on survival, there shouldn’t have been much kindness in those walls (Bly). Still, during Bly’s first meal when another patient steals the bread off her tray, another patient offers theirs out of pity (Bly). This offer is incredibly significant because the patients at Blackwell Island Asylum were mostly fed spoiled, inedible food. That woman’s empathy towards a newcomer is just one of the many examples of the community these women built amongst themselves in the cruelest of places. Bly returned the empathy, though, and advocated for the other patients during her stay, even when a nurse threatened her (59). Still, dedicated to the community she formed during those 10 days, Bly asked the nurses to help elderly patients who were getting sick, begged the doctors for warmer clothes for other patients, and reported to the doctors that the nurses were physically abusing the patients (bly). </p>
