    <h2>OBJECTIVITY</h2>

        
            <p>The general public’s ideal view of journalists is simply someone who regurgitates straight facts, completely omitting any acknowledgment of their own opinions or biases. This idea arose in the late 1890s as journalism focused more on professionalism and adopted the objectivity standard. While making straightforward, unbiased information is critical for keeping the public informed, the necessity of objectivity and plausibility in journalism is an ongoing conversation. Objectivity in journalism is essentially defined as “the attempt to identify our own biases and correct for them so they don’t inflect the conveyance of the news,” (Hond).</p>
            <p>The issue with objectivity in journalism is that regardless of the reporting, there are non-objective decisions being made that lead up to the reporting, including deciding what articles to run and what communities to cover (Hond). Journalism is “inherently political” and because of that, “objectivity is dead” (Hond). Because of this, there’s also an ongoing argument that journalists are able to connect with readers more efficiently if there is a disregard of this objectivity standard and instead transparency in identities and biases. </p>
        
    <h3>Disregarding Objectivity</h3>
    <!--insert some kind of photo of headlines perhaps-->
    <p>The stunt girls are the perfect example of how powerful journalism can be without the objectivity standard. Following their fad, amid the professionalism shift in the journalism industry, stunt journalism was eventually written off as yellow journalism and considered an embarrassing part of history. Even though these journalists went undercover in similar ways to the muckrakers, even though Nellie Bly is considered the first muckraker by many, the manner in which these journalists wrote about their issues didn’t align with the objectivity standards that were set.  </p>
    <p>Before this shift, though, the stunt girls were able to create incredibly impactful journalism because they weren’t required to adhere to objectivity standards. In embracing their identities, choosing to report specifically on stories that impacted their identities, stunt girls were able to bring immediate change to their communities.  </p>
