    <h1>Stunt Girls</h1>

    <h2>IMPACT</h2>

    <p>While empathy and forming bonds with others isn’t gender conforming, the camaraderie displayed by the stunt journalists is uniquely female. Stunt girls reported specifically on stories that were important to women, proudly displaying femininity in their works, and showcased womanhood in a positive light that was unprecedented during this time. Even though this style of journalism faded and was eventually written-off as “yellow journalism,” it’s exhilarating that women were able to publicly and professionally defy societal standards to tell their stories. </p>

      </div>
      <p>Since stunt journalism was the first time the public sees women taking center stage in journalism and putting up a considerable amount of bylines, this greatly contributed to women’s crawl towards gender equality in journalism. While sexism still exists, women now make up 46% of newsrooms (Tomasik, Gottfried). </p>
      <p>Stunt journalism also predated the muckrakers and potentially inspired their investigative reporting. The muckrakers set the standards for modern day investigative journalism, but Nellie Bly is considered the first muckraker, so Bly pioneered modern day investigative journalism.</p>
